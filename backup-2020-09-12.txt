Brok:2183:ZL:121014F:1110143:P:700::::1::N:Strategy added by Malhado\nDon&#039;t use any attacks that can swap the enemy pet with your leveling one.\n\nTurn 1: If your pet has any kind of armor, shield, healing or protective skill that lasts at least 2 rounds, use it.

Captured Evil:49NM:22201C8:ZL:1120N7:P:847::::14::N:Strategy added by Lyseria\nThis is a fork of Lazey and Applejack&#039;s strats. Due credits to them.\n\nAny snail works.\n\nI&#039;ve made this strat as consistent and as reliable as possible to play around and minimize the RNG. Please be sure to read the steps carefully.\n\nLevel Pet takes a maximum of 847 damage in the unlikely event that all 5 Void Cyclone stacks manage to hit it at FULL DAMAGE. You can definitely bring a lower hp level pet if you&#039;re not feeling unlucky.\n\nSee comments for some commentary.\n\nTurn 1: Nature's Ward\nTurn 2+: Alpha Strike until Ravage conditions are met. (see below)\nRavage: Use Ravage when Lesser Charged Gale's HP is below 618. If he doesn't die from Ravage (mostly because he used Rain Dance), use Nature's Ward then Ravage again.\n\nLesser Twisted Current comes in\nTurn 1+: Alpha Strike until Lesser Twisted Current dies. DO NOT use Nature's Ward in this fight. There's a small opportunity to use Ravage here, see below.\nRavage: Only use Ravage here if you can get his HP down to 309 or below. It's not worth killing him with Ravage over 2 turns if Alpha Strike can do it in one.\n\nMind Warper comes in\nTurn 1: Nature's Ward\nTurn 2: Alpha Strike until Teroclaw Hatchling dies. If Mind Warper goes below 30% HP, pass until Teroclaw Hatchling dies.\nBring in your Level Pet\nBring in your Rapana Whelk or Any Snail.\nTurn 1: Acidic Goo\nTurn 2: Headbutt\nTurn 3: Ooze Touch\nTurn 4: Ooze Touch\nTurn 5: Honestly, Mind Warper should have died way before this.

Mindshackle:4N95:11201TB:202015R:ZRA:N:Strategy added by Lazey\nIllusional Barrier X with only 3 rounds cooldown, Psionic Storm dealing AoE damage and changing the weather to Arcane Winds to give Psychic Blast an additional attack. Looks dangerous but my answer is... Blistering Cold :-)\n\nTo get as much Frostbite applications as possible on Mindshackle I use Blistering Cold two times before I force my Boneshard to die. To make it even worse for the opponent I also add a Bleeding effect. Black Claw and Shattered Defenses applied by Hunting Party, Flock or Swarm will then buff Frostbite/Bleeding damage.\n\nYou can replace Zandalari Raptors with Foulfeather, Ikky or Chitterspine Skitterling (8.2 Nazjatar wild catch), the script can handle them all and will also bring your third pet to pass the last turn if your birdies die.\n\nCreated and tested on 8.2 PTR\n\nTurn 1: Blistering Cold\nTurn 2: Chop\nTurn 3: BONESTORM\nTurn 4: Blistering Cold (Boneshard dies)\nBring in your Black Claw + Swarm ability pet\nTurn 1: Black Claw\nTurn 2+: Hunting Party, Flock or Swarm\n\nWhen your Mech comes in (while using vulnerable Flying pets with Black Claw)\nPass turn\n

Silence:4N90:01101FS:022014D:ZR0:N:Strategy added by Lazey\nThis Manta Ray has two Beast attacks and an empowered Flyby X which will increase the damage your pet takes by 25% for 5 rounds (classic Flyby does for 3 rounds).\n\nI am using a Black Claw + Swarm ability pet in the first slot to buff attacks of my Dragonkin. The script includes Flock and Swarm because when these 8.2 pet battles go live, the Aquatic pet Chitterspine Skitterling will be available as a wild catch in Nazjatar and it has Black Claw and Swarm. Please do not use Hunting Party pets.\n\nThe Skitterling will take more damage from Flyby X so there&#039;s a chance it will die 1 round earlier than Flying pets and you can benefit of 2 rounds Shattered Defenses and Black Claw.\n\nCreated and tested on 8.2 PTR\n\nTurn 1: Black Claw\nTurn 2+: Flock / Swarm until your pet dies. (When it does without applying Shattered Defenses, please Forfeit, Revive pets & Restart.)\n\nBring in your Nexus Whelpling\nTurn 1: Arcane Storm\nTurn 2-3: Mana Surge\nWhen your Dragon dies without killing Silence, bring in your third pet\nAny standard attack will finish the fight\n
